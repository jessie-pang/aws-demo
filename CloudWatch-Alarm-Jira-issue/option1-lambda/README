CloudWatch Alarm -> SNS -> Lambda -> Jira Rest APIs

Step-by-step:
1. Create a CloudWatch alarm with necessary metrics and thresholds;
2. Configure SNS as the target of above Cloudwatch alarm;
3. Configure Lambda as the target of above SNS;
4. Create Lambda with the code in this repo;
5. Create Lambda Environment variables as explained;
6. Create a Lambda layer for Python 'requests' library.

Test:
1. Run the following command to beat up EC2 CPU for 5 minutes:
stress --cpu 2 --timeout 300s
2. Check CloudWatch Alarm, and confirm it has been changed from 'OK' to 'In Alarm';
3. Check Lambda metrics: it should be triggered;
4. Confirm new issue has been opened in Jira. If not, check Lambda logs for any clues.
